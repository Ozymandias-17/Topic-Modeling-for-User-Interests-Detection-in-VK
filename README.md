# VK-Communities-Interests-Detection

## Overview
This project aims to understand the interests of VK (popular social network in Russia) communities by the groups they belong to. I perform topic modeling on the descriptions of these groups to identify common themes and interests. In (Code_example.ipynb) I'am conducting a thematic analysis of a group dedicated to the work of Hayao Miyazaki.
